__Inventory Optimization using Time Series Forecasting__

Leveraging Facebook Prophet to Predict Demand and Streamline Supply Chain Decisions

__Problem Statement__

Retail companies often struggle with fluctuating demand, leading to overstocking or stockouts, which result in increased holding costs or missed sales opportunities. Accurate demand forecasting is essential for:

Efficient inventory management

Strategic procurement planning

Maximizing customer satisfaction

Reducing operational costs

__Objective__

To develop a scalable and interpretable time series forecasting model using Facebook Prophet that accurately predicts future retail sales. The forecasts will be used to guide supply chain decisions, promotional planning, and inventory optimization.

__Project Overview__

This project uses historical retail sales data to:

Conduct time series exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Train a forecasting model using Prophet

Evaluate model performance using statistical metrics

Visualize forecasts and trends

Provide actionable business insights

__Methodology__

1. __Data Collection & Preparation__

Input: Historical sales data (sales_data.csv) with columns like Date, Sales, Store, Product_Category

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, duplicates, and anomalies

Aggregation: Grouping sales at daily or weekly levels for selected categories/stores

2. __Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)__

Seasonal decomposition of time series

Trend visualization and outlier detection

Correlation with promotional periods or holidays

3. __Forecasting with Facebook Prophet__

Prophet handles trend, seasonality (weekly, yearly), and holiday effects

Model training on 80% of the time series, validation on 20%

Cross-validation with rolling windows

4. __Evaluation Metrics__

Metric

Description

MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

Measures average magnitude of errors

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

Penalizes larger errors more heavily

MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)

Interpretable error percentage

5. __Visualization & Reporting__

Forecast plots with confidence intervals

Trend and seasonality component plots

Business dashboards (optional extension with Streamlit or Power BI)

__Business Impact__

The insights and forecasts from this model can:

Improve procurement accuracy by predicting demand spikes and dips

Assist in budgeting and revenue planning

Optimize warehouse and logistics by adjusting stock levels proactively

Enable targeted promotions based on expected customer footfall


__Sample Use Cases__

Grocery Chains: Anticipating holiday surges and planning staff/inventory accordingly

Fashion Retail: Predicting seasonal demand changes in apparel lines

E-Commerce: Planning flash sales based on forecasted peak days

__Future Work__

Model comparisons with ARIMA, XGBoost, and LSTM

SKU-level or region-level batch forecasting

Real-time forecasting pipeline with cloud deployment (AWS/GCP)

Dashboard interface using Streamlit or Dash for business users

__Tools & Technologies__

Language: Python 3.9+

Libraries: Facebook Prophet, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

Optional Add-ons: Streamlit (for dashboard), AWS S3 (for data storage)
